# NIGERIA COVID19 VACCINES ALLOCATION REPORT

## Introduction
This project is about creating a power BI report that will help Nigeria allocate Covid-19 Vaccines and also help improve health care by building health care centers across the states in the Country.

## Analysis Objectives

The research questions answered in this project analysis objectives were based on the following :

* The total population being vaccinated out of the total general population of the country.
* The total number of people being affected with the virus, the number being cured and the number of those that are dead.
* The general population, the population affected, cured and vaccinated in states.
* Population of those that died in each states.
* Rate at which people are being affected by the years.

## Conclusions

The conclusions drawn from this report are:

* Lagos, Edo and Oyo states respectively recorded the highest number of deaths.
* Edo state that does not fall in the category of the top 15 states with the highest population, which implies they have a low population (of 4,235,595) has more affected people and more deaths compared to Kano state with the highest population of 15,076,892.
* 75,285 people were affected in Jan 2021, but the rate of people affected reduced after vaccination began in March 2021. though the rate increase a little bit in July 2021, but it finally reduced to 10,577 after the vaccinated became more effective in Jan 2022.

## Recommendations
* Enough awareness should be made to all the citizens about covid vaccination so that the spread of the virus can keep reducing.
* More vaccines should be distributed to states (like kano, lagos, kaduna, oyo, etc) with high populations because the virus has high tendency of spreading more in those environments.
* Government should build more health care centers in kano state because they have the highest population, but low number of vaccinated people.
* More vaccines should be provided in Federal Capital Territory because despite not falling among the first 20 states with the highest population, it is the second state with the highest number of affected people.
